#Foodar
This is my website for a food delivery service
this project was created for functionality over
design as you may find out I have a zipcode checker
on the main page that works with a hard coded array
of dummy zip codes also the "Request page" has a total 
tracker based on user-input the initial value of a meal
starts at $10 and the price is calculated per the values
above the radio buttons.
